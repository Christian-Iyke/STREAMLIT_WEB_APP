    "## STREAMLIT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit is an open-source tool to build and deploy data applications with less coding compared to other front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a low-code tool specifically designed for building data science applications.\n",
    "Moreover, the Streamlit library has functions and methods in pure Python to develop data applications with minimal code. Streamlit also supports various database connections, like AWS S3, MS SQL Server, Oracle DB, spreadsheets, etc.\n",
    "We will divide the article into three parts: the first part takes you through Streamlit’s core APIs, followed by Streamlit cloud deployment, and in the last part, we will build the Streamlit app to predict road traffic accident severity with code snippets. So, let us delve into the streamlit library to create data web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MORE ON STREAMLIT\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers. Data scientists or machine learning engineers are not web developers and they're not interested in spending weeks learning to use these frameworks to build web apps. Instead, they want a tool that is easier to learn and to use, as long as it can display data and collect needed parameters for modeling. Streamlit allows you to create a stunning-looking application with only a few lines of code.\n",
    "Why should data scientists use Streamlit?\n",
    "The best thing about Streamlit is that you don't even need to know the basics of web development to get started or to create your first web application. So if you're somebody who's into data science and you want to deploy your models easily, quickly, and with only a few lines of code, Streamlit is a good fit.\n",
    "One of the important aspects of making an application successful is to deliver it with an effective and intuitive user interface. Many of the modern data-heavy apps face the challenge of building an effective user interface quickly, without taking complicated steps. Streamlit is a promising open-source Python library, which enables developers to build attractive user interfaces in no time.\n",
    "Streamlit is the easiest way especially for people with no front-end knowledge to put their code into a web application:\n",
    "•\tNo front-end (html, js, css) experience or knowledge is required.\n",
    "•\tYou don't need to spend days or months to create a web app, you can create a really beautiful machine learning or data science app in only a few hours or even minutes.\n",
    "•\tIt is compatible with the majority of Python libraries (e.g. pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex)).\n",
    "•\tLess code is needed to create amazing web apps.\n",
    "•\tData caching simplifies and speeds up computation pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Streamlit Library’s Core APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streamlit library provides widgets and UI layout components to develop data-powered web applications. In this section, we’ll look at some of the widgets provided by the library, along with code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Text elements\n",
    "Streamlit has features that allow you to display textual content in the form of titles, headers, subheaders, plain text, and so on. Text elements are useful to display text content on the website with titles and subheaders. Let’s look at some of the examples of text widgets by streamlit.\n",
    " \n",

    "    a left(frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}right)\n",
    "    ''')\n",
    " \n",
    "# 2. Data display elements\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, in any data science project, we have to showcase datasets to provide a brief overview of the data problem we worked on and the complexity of the dataset. Streamlit has in-built features that allow data scientists to display datasets, tables, and JSON objects with just one line of code.\n",
    "Let’s look at the examples of data display widgets:\n",

    "Guide to Deploying Apps on Streamlit Community Cloud\n",
    "Deploying web applications on streamlit is much easier compared to traditional app deployments. Streamlit Cloud directly launches apps from the Github repository, and it does not require configuration settings at the backend or defining routes for your application.\n",
    "Streamlit Community Cloud automates the build process and deploys apps without developer intervention. Furthermore, Streamlit supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and automatically pulls code changes from the project repository. As an open-source and community cloud project, Streamlit provides all services for free.\n",
    "Streamlit also provides build logs to troubleshoot errors during the deployment of web apps on the cloud. It provides comprehensive exceptions and error documentation to solve common issues with ease. If the problem persists, contact the streamlit support team for assistance.\n",
    "Now, let’s look at the steps to deploy your data apps on the streamlit cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. To deploy an app, you have to click on the “New App” button on the upper right corner of your workspace, and then the below window will pop up.\n",
    "                                                                                 \n",
    "### 2. After opening the “Deploy an app” window, you have to select the repository where your project files reside, the branch of the project file, and finally main file path to deploy your app in ONE click!\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we have selected below repository, branch, and path files to deploy the “TimeSeries store Anaylysis” classification app.\n",
    "                                                                             \n",
    "Apart from this, streamlit allows advanced settings to customize the python version and store any API keys depending on your project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Once you click that “Deploy” button, it will automatically deploy the app on the streamlit public cloud and install all the dependencies to run the app. at the end of the build process, you will be redirected to the web portal through the standard URL assigned by streamlit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the streamlit app URL looks like as below:\n",
    "https://[user name]-[repo name]-[branch name]-[app path]-[short hash].streamlit.app\n",
    "\n",
    "Streamlit also supports various database sources such as AWS S3, BigQuery, MongoDB, MS SQL server, MySQL, and more.\n",
    "Develop, Build and Deploy a Streamlit App With Source Code\n",
    "In this section, we will develop a streamlit web application to predict road accident severity and reduce potentially fatal accidents.\n",
    "The dataset for this application was collected from the Addis Ababa Sub-city Police Department by a master’s degree student for their research work. The dataset had 32 features and 12316 instances to train and test machine learning models. The source of the dataset can be found here.\n",
